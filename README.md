Crowdfunding Platform Analysis.

1. Overview
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of crowdfunding campaigns using a dataset of 1,000 sample projects. Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have revolutionized funding for various projects, from individual initiatives to large-scale ventures. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns that contribute to the success or failure of these campaigns.

2. Data Enhancement:

Apply conditional formatting to visually distinguish the outcomes of campaigns in the dataset.
Introduce a "Percent Funded" column to calculate the ratio of funds raised to the initial goal.
Calculate "Average Donation" per campaign to understand donor contributions.
Segment the "Category and Sub-Category" column into two distinct columns for clearer categorization.

3. Category Analysis:

Utilize pivot tables to assess the number of campaigns by outcome across different categories.
Create a stacked-column pivot chart with a filter option for country for a visual representation of the data.

4. Subcategory Analysis:

Perform a similar analysis as above, focusing on sub-categories to pinpoint more specific trends.

5. Date Conversion:

Convert Unix timestamps in "deadline" and "launched_at" columns to readable date formats for better analysis.
Launch Date Impact:Examine how launch dates influence campaign outcomes through pivot tables and line graphs.

6. Reporting
Drafted a report addressing the following:

Key findings on crowdfunding campaign trends.
Limitations of the current dataset.
Recommendations for additional analyses that could provide further insights.
Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
Construct a new sheet to analyze the impact of crowdfunding goals on campaign outcomes, including: Success, failure, and cancellation rates by goal range.
A line chart depicting the relationship between goal amounts and campaign outcomes.
Statistical Analysis:
    Evaluate the significance of campaign backers in determining the success of crowdfunding efforts through:
        Summary statistics of backer numbers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
        Comparative analysis to ascertain the more representative measure between the mean and median number of backers.
        Analysis of variability in backer numbers between successful and unsuccessful campaigns to understand underlying patterns.
        This project aims to deliver actionable insights for optimizing crowdfunding strategies through detailed data analysis.
